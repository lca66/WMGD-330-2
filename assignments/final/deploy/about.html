                            Peicha Chang is the founder of Vault + Vine. In 2009, she founded Falls
                            Flowers, a floral design shop in East Falls, before transitioning the
                            business to Vault + Vine in 2017. Before Falls Flowers, Peicha was a
                            designer and manager at Bow Street Flowers in Boston, Massachusetts. At Bow
                            Street, Peicha honed her design sensibilities and discovered her love of
                            garden style design.

                                  Conrad Street, Peicha and her team have outgrown the space and have
                                  committed to their new location here on Midvale to offer an immersive retail
                                  experience while providing the community with a cafe, gathering place, and

                                  Our customers are friends and neighbors who, over the years, have become
                                  family. Local creators, whose hands are part of every process of making
                                  their goods, produce many of the objects we carry. The seasonal flowers we
                                  use in our arrangements are grown in and around Philadelphia at small farms,
                                  and are harvested and delivered to us by the same farmers who planted the
                                  seeds. Any of our products or flowers not locally produced or grown are
                                  always sourced responsibly and ethically.

                                            cut flower farm in Doylestown, PA. Through farming, she formed

                                            love for floral design. In 2016 she started From Blossoms, her own
