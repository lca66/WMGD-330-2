  <h3 class="heading">We're a B-Corperation</h3>
  <p>
    Falls Flowers was the first floral-retail and event design studio to ‘live”
    sustainably as one of 1,600+ businesses worldwide that is a certified
    B-Corp, and Vault + Vine aims to continue that legacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    A B-Corp is a for-profit company certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet
    rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability,
    and transparency. Our motto is “People using business as a force for good,’
    with a focus on a triple bottom line: people, planet, AND profit.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strive to do what a good business should do: support our community, buy
    and source locally, pay our employees well, and follow high standards of
    sustainability.
