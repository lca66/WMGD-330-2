      <p>
        Katâ€™s love of flowers started while she was a grower, managing a 3-acre
        cut flower farm in Doylestown, PA. Through farming, she formed
        relationships with floral designers in Philadelphia and discovered a
        love for floral design. In 2016 she started From Blossoms, her own
        floral design/flower csa business, based out of Germantown.

        Meg is a born-and-raised East Fallser! She can be seen walking her pup
        Noah around the neighborhood, enjoying margaritas at Taqueria Feliz, or
        creating fabulous arrangements for events here at Vault + Vine. Around
        the shop she likes to chat about movies and podcasts. Her favorite
        flowers are ranunculus for their delicacy and straw flowers for their
        iridescence.
