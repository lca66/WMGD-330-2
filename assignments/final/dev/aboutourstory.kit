  <p>
    Vault + Vine is the re-envisioning of Peicha Changâ€™s Falls Flowers. After
    spending the last five years at their little storefront around the corner on
    Conrad Street, Peicha and her team have outgrown the space and have
    committed to their new location here on Midvale to offer an immersive retail
    experience while providing the community with a cafe, gathering place, and
    small scale event venue.

    Our customers are friends and neighbors who, over the years, have become
    family. Local creators, whose hands are part of every process of making
    their goods, produce many of the objects we carry. The seasonal flowers we
    use in our arrangements are grown in and around Philadelphia at small farms,
    and are harvested and delivered to us by the same farmers who planted the
    seeds. Any of our products or flowers not locally produced or grown are
    always sourced responsibly and ethically.
